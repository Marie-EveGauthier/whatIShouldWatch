    <h2>About</h2>
    <h4>The Idea</h2>
    <p>To build a recommender system that will highlight movies that tell the stories of people who have been invisibilized by mainstream hollywood</p>
    <h4>How it Works</h2>
    <p>Our tool allows the user to explore a data set of two thousand films based on the following filters:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>
            Whether the film passes the Bechdel Test.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            Whether the film was written or directed by a woman.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            Whether at least fifty percent of the dialogue spoken by main characters is said by characters who are women.
        </li>       
    </ul>
    <h4>How We Got Our Data</h2>
    <p>We found the work of <a href="http://polygraph.cool/films/">Matthew Daniels</a>, who did script analysis on a set of two thousand films.</br>
        For each of these films, he calculated the amount of dialogue spoken by men and women main characters.</br> 
        We used his data set as a starting point for our project.
    </p>
    <p><a href="Bechdeltest.com">Bechdeltest.com</a>is a website that aggregates user generated data 
        on whether or not films pass the Bechdel test. 
        We scraped bechdeltest.com to determine whether or not the films in the dataset of two thousand films 
        passed the Bechdel test. Not all of those two thousand films were listed on bechdeltest.com.
    </p>
    <p>We used the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">open movie database API</a> to get the names of the directors and writers of the films in our dataset. 
    To determine the gender identity of the directors and writers on our list, 
    we used several different data sources. First, we queried wikipedia with their names, 
    and got back a list of categories which described how they were categorized on wikipedia. 
    We marked which people were categorized as women directors or women writers. 
    Not everyone has a page on wikipedia.</br>
    We scraped <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">imdb (the internet movie database)</a> for the missing names 
    and analyzed the pronouns in their imdb bio to determine the personâ€™s gender.</br> 
    We recognize that gender identity is complex and that our method for determining gender identity has limitations.
